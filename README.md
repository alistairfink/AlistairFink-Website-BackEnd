# Personal Website Backend

This is probably around version 4 or 5 of the back end for this website. I created this based off my original go based backend for my website which I used as a POC combined it with a stronger knowledge of web architecture and design patterns. I was unhappy with the original stack I had chosen for my website as the architecture was a mess and it was very poorly written and not very maintable. I was planning on replacing this it at some point but had never really gotten around to it. Eventually my VPS provider went backrupt without warning and I lost my entire database. This prompted me to simply get around to redoing the entire stack using go, a language I've grown to love in the past 6 months. In the end the new stack is a React front end, go back end, and Postgres DB.
